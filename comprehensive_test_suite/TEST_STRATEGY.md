# Comprehensive Testing Strategy

## Objectives
Establish a healthcare-grade quality assurance program ensuring HIPAA compliance, 99% claims accuracy, and high availability for the NPHIES-AI platform.

## Test Coverage Targets
| Layer | Coverage Goal |
|-------|---------------|
| Unit (Python/JS) | ≥ 90% statements for core services |
| Integration (API, NPHIES) | 100% of critical workflows |
| End-to-End (Web, Mobile) | Critical paths (claims, eligibility, pre-auth) |
| Load & Stress | Sustained 500 RPS, spike to 1,500 RPS |
| Security | OWASP Top 10, HIPAA safeguards |
| Compliance | FHIR validation, audit logging, disaster recovery |

## Test Types & Tooling

### 1. Unit Tests
* **Backend:** pytest + pytest-asyncio for FastAPI routes, service layers, and AWS clients (use `moto`/`localstack` for mocks).
* **Frontend:** Jest + React Testing Library (post refactor) or Vitest for modular JS utilities.
* **AI Models:** Use `pytest` fixtures validating schema, prompt formatting, and fallback logic.

### 2. Contract & Integration Tests
* Create mocked NPHIES server using Prism/MockServer to validate FHIR payloads and error conditions.
* Use `httpx.AsyncClient` with FastAPI TestClient for end-to-end API validation including auth, RBAC, and audit logging.
* Verify AWS integrations with LocalStack (SQS, Lambda, Bedrock stub) and snapshot expected payloads.

### 3. End-to-End (E2E)
* **Web:** Playwright test suites covering login, dashboard, claim submission, eligibility checks, AI assistant interactions.
* **Mobile:** Detox/Appium workflows verifying offline queues, push notifications, biometric unlock.
* **Accessibility:** axe-core scans + manual screen reader testing.

### 4. Performance & Reliability
* k6 load tests simulating provider and insurer traffic; produce Grafana dashboards for latency/error distribution.
* Chaos engineering via AWS Fault Injection Simulator—test ECS task restarts, database failover, and degraded NPHIES responses.
* Soak tests (6-12 hours) to detect memory leaks and queue backlogs.

### 5. Security Testing
* Automate SAST (Bandit, Semgrep) and dependency scanning (Trivy, Safety) in CI.
* Run DAST with OWASP ZAP targeting staging environment; include authenticated scans.
* Commission annual penetration tests and quarterly HIPAA security assessments.

### 6. Compliance & Data Integrity
* FHIR validator suite (HL7 FHIR validator, Inferno) for claim/eligibility bundles.
* Audit log verification ensuring every state transition recorded with immutable IDs.
* Disaster recovery drills validating RPO ≤ 5 minutes, RTO ≤ 30 minutes; test backup restore.

## Test Data Management
* Generate synthetic datasets with anonymised PHI using Faker + SDV, stored in encrypted S3 buckets.
* Mask production data before use; maintain data retention policies and cleanup jobs.

## Automation & Reporting
* Integrate tests into GitHub Actions workflow (`cicd_pipeline_setup.yml`).
* Publish coverage reports to Codecov; fail build if coverage < 85% (hard gate 90% for release).
* Push test results and accessibility scores to shared dashboard for stakeholders.
* Implement quality gates in Jira—user stories blocked until acceptance criteria automated.

## Governance
* QA sign-off checklist covering regression, security, compliance, and accessibility.
* Release readiness reviews with stakeholders (product, compliance, DevSecOps).
* Post-release monitoring with error budgets and rollback criteria.
