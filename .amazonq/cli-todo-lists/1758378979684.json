Found basic FastAPI routing with static file serving for pages like login, dashboard, nphies, profile, notifications, pre-authorization, eligibility, ai-assistant, claims, settings, and health-services. Current routing is simple with direct file serving, no advanced navigation handling or error scenarios covered.","Created enhanced routing system with comprehensive navigation guards, error handling, and AWS services integration. Built navigation components with breadcrumbs, active states, keyboard shortcuts, and accessibility features. Created AWS services asset files with healthcare workflow automation.","Created comprehensive routing system with lazy loading, code splitting, enhanced navigation components, error pages (404, 500), and AWS services integration. Added route-based resource loading, preloading strategies, PWA support, and comprehensive error handling. Updated main.py with enhanced routing endpoints and navigation API.","Successfully deployed enhanced routing system with comprehensive navigation, error handling, lazy loading, and AWS services integration. The system is now live with task definition revision 11 using the enhanced-routing image. Navigation API endpoints are working correctly, returning structured route information with categories and authentication requirements. All routing features including breadcrumbs, error pages (404/500), and AWS services integration are now active."],"modified_files":["/Users/fadil369/nphies_linc_app/static/js/router.js","/Users/fadil369/nphies_linc_app/static/js/aws-services.js","/Users/fadil369/nphies_linc_app/static/js/navigation.js","/Users/fadil369/nphies_linc_app/static/js/router.js","/Users/fadil369/nphies_linc_app/static/js/aws-services.js","/Users/fadil369/nphies_linc_app/static/js/navigation.js","/Users/fadil369/nphies_linc_app/static/js/lazy-loader.js","/Users/fadil369/nphies_linc_app/static/css/routing.css","/Users/fadil369/nphies_linc_app/main.py","/Users/fadil369/nphies_linc_app/static/404.html","/Users/fadil369/nphies_linc_app/static/500.html","/Users/fadil369/nphies_linc_app/static/js/router.js","/Users/fadil369/nphies_linc_app/static/js/aws-services.js","/Users/fadil369/nphies_linc_app/static/js/navigation.js","/Users/fadil369/nphies_linc_app/static/js/lazy-loader.js","/Users/fadil369/nphies_linc_app/static/css/routing.css","/Users/fadil369/nphies_linc_app/main.py","/Users/fadil369/nphies_linc_app/static/404.html","/Users/fadil369/nphies_linc_app/static/500.html"],"id":"1758378979684"}
