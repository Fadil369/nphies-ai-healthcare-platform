# UI/UX Enhancement Plan

## Current Experience Assessment
* **Navigation:** Router performs full page swaps without preserving focus or announcing navigation changes for assistive technologies.【F:static/js/router.js†L167-L215】
* **Accessibility:** No ARIA landmarks, keyboard traps, or skip links are defined; notifications rely on visual cues only.【F:static/js/router.js†L300-L371】
* **Responsiveness:** Static HTML templates lack responsive layout utilities and do not adapt to smaller screens (no CSS grid/flex patterns observed in repository).
* **Healthcare-specific workflows:** Claim, eligibility, and pre-authorisation pages are static HTML without form validation or progress indicators, leading to high cognitive load.【F:static/js/lazy-loader.js†L100-L176】

## Design Goals
1. Achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support).
2. Provide intuitive healthcare workflows with contextual guidance, status indicators, and audit visibility.
3. Deliver responsive, mobile-first layouts with bilingual (Arabic/English) support.
4. Improve perceived performance with skeleton screens, optimistic UI updates, and micro-interactions.

## Enhancement Backlog

### Accessibility & Compliance
* Introduce semantic HTML structure (landmarks, headings, ARIA roles).
* Implement focus management in router; announce route changes via `aria-live` regions.
* Provide keyboard-accessible navigation menus, skip links, and high-contrast themes.
* Add form validation errors with text + ARIA descriptions; ensure error summaries focus first invalid field.

### Responsive & Bilingual Design
* Adopt responsive grid system (CSS Grid/Flexbox) with breakpoints for desktop/tablet/mobile.
* Localise UI copy and support RTL layouts for Arabic (mirrored components, fonts supporting Arabic script).
* Add toggles for dark/light modes stored per user profile.

### Healthcare Workflow Enhancements
* Build guided claim wizard with step progress, required document checklist, and inline eligibility hints.
* Display claim status timelines (submitted → adjudicated → paid) with icons and SLA countdown.
* Provide emergency quick-access cards with contact shortcuts and triage guidelines.
* Integrate eligibility dashboards showing coverage summaries, co-pay amounts, and prior authorisation requirements.

### Performance & Feedback
* Use skeleton loaders and shimmer effects for dashboard metrics.
* Prefetch critical route data (claims, eligibility) via Service Worker caches and stale-while-revalidate strategy.
* Add toast notifications with screen reader announcements for success/failure states.

### Usability Testing & Metrics
* Conduct heuristic evaluation with clinicians and billing specialists.
* Run moderated usability tests focusing on claim submission and eligibility verification.
* Track task success rate, time-on-task, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and System Usability Scale (SUS) per release.

## Deliverables
1. Updated design system (Figma) with healthcare-specific components.
2. Frontend implementation plan (React or Web Components) with accessibility acceptance criteria.
3. Localization guidelines and glossary for Arabic-English terminology.
4. Analytics instrumentation plan for user journey tracking and drop-off analysis.
