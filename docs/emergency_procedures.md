# Emergency Procedures

## Purpose
Ensure rapid, compliant response to clinical emergencies, system outages, or security breaches impacting PHI and patient care.

## Clinical Emergency Workflow
1. **Detection:** Patient or provider triggers emergency flag in portal or via hotline.
2. **Triage:** Emergency operations center reviews case, verifies patient identity, and accesses critical data (allergies, coverage).
3. **Authorization Bypass:** Temporarily bypass prior authorization and eligibility steps as permitted by CHI regulations, logging justification.
4. **Notification:** Alert care team, insurer, and compliance officer via PagerDuty/SMS.
5. **Documentation:** Record services provided, timeline, and participants in emergency log.
6. **Post-Event Review:** Within 24 hours, reconcile services, restore standard workflows, and produce compliance report.

## System Outage Procedure
1. Notify on-call engineering via PagerDuty (SEV1) and post status update to StatusPage.
2. Activate disaster recovery plan: failover to secondary region or read-only mode.
3. Restore from backups if data corruption detected; validate integrity before reopening access.
4. Communicate ETA, mitigation steps, and resolution summary to stakeholders.

## Security Breach Response
1. Contain incident (revoke credentials, isolate systems, disable compromised integrations).
2. Collect forensic evidence (logs, memory dumps) and engage security response team.
3. Notify leadership, legal, and compliance within 1 hour; follow regulatory breach notification requirements.
4. Conduct root cause analysis and implement corrective actions.
