* Remediate critical vulnerabilities within 24 hours, high within 72 hours.
* Conduct regular penetration tests and dependency audits.

## 7. Monitoring & Incident Response
* Continuous monitoring via GuardDuty, Security Hub, CloudWatch alarms (`monitoring_dashboard_config.json`).

* Maintain immutable audit logs and retention policies (â‰¥6 years HIPAA).

## 8. Vendor & Third-Party Risk
